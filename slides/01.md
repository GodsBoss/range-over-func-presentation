# Range over func

Introduced with [Go 1.23](https://go.dev/doc/go1.23) ([language changes](https://go.dev/doc/go1.23#language)).

Adds another valid `value` for `for range` loops after slices, maps, arrays, strings, channels and integers.

Functions that can be ranged over have one of the following types (with `K` and `V` being arbitrary types):

```go
func(func() bool)
func(func(K) bool)
func(func(K, V) bool)
```

This presentation tries to answer the following questions:

* Why were they introduced?
* How do we use them?
* How do they work?
* How do we implement them?
