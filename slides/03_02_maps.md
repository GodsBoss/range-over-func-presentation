# Can't we use existing mechanisms?

## Maps

Maps share nearly these drawbacks with slices:

* Parts of a slice may have been created for nothing if only a part of that slice is used in the end.
* Can't start "doing work" before the slice is constructed.
* You cannot model a potentially infinite amount of values.
* Not really suited when processing elements would add elements to process.
* Functions for filtering or mapping values create intermediate slices.

In addition:

* Iteration is limited to `[K comparable, V any]` pairs.
* Iteration order cannot be controlled.
