# Notes

## Naming

* Rangefunc iterators "push" values into a piece of code, thus their label "push iterators".

## n-valued iterators

* In addition to one- and two-valued iterators, zero-valued iterators exist: `func (yield func() bool)`
* Iterators with three or more values (e.g. `func (yield func(A, B, C) bool)`) do _not_ exist.

## [iter](https://pkg.go.dev/iter) package

* Defines types for one- and two-valued iterators (`iter.Seq`, `iter.Seq2`).
* Defines no type for zero-valued iterators.
* Provides functions for converting one-valued and two-valued rangefunc iterators into "pull" iterators.
* No function is provided for zero-valued rangefunc iterators.
