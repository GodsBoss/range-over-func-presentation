# Why range over func?

The official [Go blog](https://go.dev/blog/) provides an extensive [Range Over Function Types](https://go.dev/blog/range-functions) post. TLDR: There is no standard way for a custom collection-like type to expose a way to iterate over all its values. The blog post mentions a few functions that all work kind of similiar in that they accept a function and are responsible for calling that function repeatedly with values (a.k.a. "pushing" the values), but they all differ in important details:

* [`flag#Visit`](https://pkg.go.dev/flag#Visit) calls the function with all flags, there is no way for an early exit.
* [`sync.Map#Range`](https://pkg.go.dev/sync.Map#Range) stops when the given function returns `false`.
* [`filepath#Walk`](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Walk) lets the function choose wether to continue, skip a few values, skip all remaining values or skip all remaining values and return with an error.

Inconsistent interfaces makes it impossible to create solutions that apply to all of them. A standard for such iterations would solve this issue.
