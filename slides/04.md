# How do we use them?

Easy: Just `range` over them. Let's look at an example. Here, `naturalNumbers` is an iterator that creates natural numbers as `int64`s, indefinitely (technically we'll run into issues after reaching the maximum for `int64`). We'll ignore the iterator and just look at the `for` loop.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	for n := range naturalNumbers {
		if n%2 == 0 {
			continue
		}
		if n > 20 {
			break
		}
		fmt.Println(n)
	}
}

func naturalNumbers(yield func(n int64) bool) {
	current := int64(0)
	for yield(current) {
		current++
	}
}
```

Output ([playground](https://go.dev/play/p/edkSAFC0aJA)):
```
1
3
5
7
9
11
13
15
17
19
```

This seems pretty straightforward: Subsequently numbers are provided, `0`, `1`, `2`, etc. For even numbers (`n%2 == 0` is `true`) we skip to the next value, if the number provided is greater than 20 (`n > 20` is `true`), we break off the loop. Else we just print the number.
